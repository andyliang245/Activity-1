## My name is Andy. I graduated from the University of Washington, Bothell campus with a degree in Business, concentrating in Financing. I am currently a Senior Alternative Fund Accountant for SS&C ALPS, a subsidiary to SS&C Technologies. With finance background through my education and career background, I would like to expand my knowledge into the FinTech world and apply technological advancements in financial services world. I am hoping upon completion of this class, I will be able to utilize the knowledge I gain in the class and my experience to have a career in the investment finance world.
